### Biography

Tomas loves good coffee, meeting PHP programmers from all around the world who bring inspiration to his life and helping people to become their best selves. No surprise he's the founder of [Pehapkari - the Czech PHP Community](https://pehapkari.cz/), [a writer](https://www.tomasvotruba.cz/) and part-time open-source developer.

He was a trainer in the past, but when he saw all the companies have the same problem with the old and crappy code, he made a tool called Rector, that migrates and upgrade PHP faster then your CI build finishes. 

Now he's traveling around world conference and cities and sharing his knowledge. His goal is so all the PHP programmers in the world can work with a brand new version of PHP, their framework and the most modern patterns. When this is finished, he can happily die making his dream come true :)
