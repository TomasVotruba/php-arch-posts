### Biography

Tomas loves good coffee, meeting PHP programmers from all around the world who bring inspiration to his life and helping people to become their best selves. No surprise he's the founder of [Pehapkari - the Czech PHP Community](https://pehapkari.cz/), [a writer](https://www.tomasvotruba.cz/) and part-time open-source developer.

He was a trainer and consultant of PHP companies, but when he saw all the companies have the same problem with the old and crappy code, he made a tool called Rector, that migrates and upgrade PHP faster then your CI build finishes.

Now he's traveling around the world, visiting many conferences and cities, sharing his extensive knowledge. His goal is that all the PHP programmers in the world can work with the latest PHP versions, their favorite frameworks, and modern patterns. When the entire world is upgraded, his dream will have come true, and he would die a happy man :)
